## Introduction

This exploratory data analysis was created as a capstone project for the Data Analysis and Visualization section of the Data Science course of **Start2Impact**, an italian startup (*B Corp certified*) which has been selected among the best ones in Europe in terms of education and social impact by the European Social Innovation Competition.

The analysis is already structured as a notebook which contains a formal presentation of the themes, the datasets and every information needed in order to understand what was done during the six different phases of the analysis. This section, on the other hand, will be an informal and brief explanation of why I chose this theme.

## Reasons behind my choice

I was 14 years old when I read the term "positive mindset" for the first time, I've always been fascinated by the power of the mind and the I remember being absolutely stunned when I read about the huge impact we can make on our lives by rewiring our brain to take the best out of every situation.
From that moment on I've been trying to apply what I read, which hasn't been an easy task at all, but very rewarding I must say.

Given this premises, the **World Happiness Report** was love at first sight for me, and what was even more interesting about this project was the possibility to combine more datasets to obtain a clear but at the same time complex view of several factors interacting. I choose the **Human Freedom Index** as the second main dataset due to my firm belonging in "No freedom til we're all equal" [^1]. Studying different freedom indexes helped me understand how the world is moving, and what encouraged me even more to use this dataset was the presence of a specific freedom index for women, which compared for each country the amount of freedom women have with respect to to that of men. 

## What's inside
The notebook is structured in six sections, if you're interested in the whole analysis you can read it top to bottom, otherwise there are links that will direct you to the most interesting parts, which are the data exploration and data visualization phases. Each visualization has a brief description of the findings and some of them are interactive, meaning that they allow you to filter them or obtain further insights.
