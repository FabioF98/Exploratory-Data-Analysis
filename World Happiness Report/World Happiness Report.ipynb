    "The main objective of this report is to understand how happiness relates to socio-economic factors, what are the countries that lead the rankings for happiness and what makes them stand out with respect to the rest. The first data set chosen for this report is the World Happiness Report, my choice to go for the most recent data set was dictated by the will to deepen the understanding, both mine and of the reader, of how happiness relates to subjective well-being and how social, urban and natural environments affect the happiness level. Data regarding all of these factors has been provided in data sets from year 2020 on. This data set alone can provide numerous insights on happiness, but is missing something which I consider crucial when studying human behaviour, which is the level of freedom each country provides, and this is where the second data set, The Human Freedom Index, comes into play. The Human Freedom Index analyzes an extraordinary number of factors and summarizes them into a score. A brief introduction to both data sets is provided below, while a detailed explanation of the key components of each data set is provided in the [appendix](#chosethisappendix-a-class\"anchor\"-id\"1\"a).\n",

    "\n",
    "The World Happiness Report (WHR) is based on the science of wellbeing, which uses quantitative methods to understand how different life experiences influence people's happiness and quality of life. Their annual report is published by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network and is focused on monitoring wellbeing as well as its causes and consequences around the world. The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across fields - economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more - describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This question, known as the Cantril ladder, asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale. The scores are from nationally representative samples for the years 2020-2022 and use the Gallup weights to make the estimates representative.\n",

    "### About The Human Freedom Index\n",
    "\n",
    "The Human Freedom Index presents the state of human freedom in the world based on a broad measure that encompasses personal, civil, and economic freedom. Human freedom is a social concept that recognizes the dignity of individuals and is defined here as negative liberty or the absence of coercive constraint. Because freedom is inherently valuable and plays a role in human progress, it is worth measuring carefully. The Human Freedom Index is a resource that can help to more objectively observe relationships between freedom and other social and economic phenomena, as well as the ways in which the various dimensions of freedom interact with one another. The report is co​published by the Cato Institute and the Fraser Institute.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HFI is the most comprehensive freedom index so far created for a globally meaningful set of countries and jurisdictions representing 98.1 percent of the world’s population. This seventh annual index uses 82 distinct indicators of personal and economic freedom in the following area : rule of law; security and safety; movement; religion; association, assembly and civil society; expression and information; relationships; size of government, legal system and property rights; sound money; freedom to trade internationally and regulation.\n",

    "## Data Cleaning\n",
    "The first step is to import all the libraries we will need throughout the phases of data cleaning, data exploration, data transformation and data visualization, followed by the import of the datasets needed. One of the datasets, The Human Freedom Index one, already contains data for previous years, whereas data for the World Happiness Report are stored in different csv files based on the year of collection.

    "\n",
    "* **Happiness score or subjective well-being** (variable name ladder) : is the national average response to the question of life evaluations. The English wording of the question is “Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?” This measure is also referred to as Cantril life ladder.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **GDP per capita** variable name gdp \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Healthy Life Expectancy** (HLE) : healthy life expectancies at birth are based on the data extracted from the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Global Health Observatory data repository\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Social support** (or having someone to count on in times of trouble) : is the national average of the binary responses (either 0 or 1) to the GWP question “If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?”\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Freedom to make life choices** : is the national average of responses to the GWP question “Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?”\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Generosity** : is the residual of regressing national average of response to the GWP question “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?” on GDP per capita.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Corruption Perception** : The measure is the national average of the survey responses to two questions in the GWP: “Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not” and “Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?” The overall perception is just the average of the two 0-or-1 responses. In case the perception of government corruption is missing, we use the perception of business corruption as the overall perception. The corruption perception at the national level is just the average response of the overall perception at the individual level.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Positive affect** : is defined as the average of three positive affect measures in GWP: laugh, enjoyment and doing interesting things in the Gallup World Poll waves 3-7. These measures are the responses to the following three questions, respectively: “Did you smile or laugh a lot yesterday?”, and “Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Enjoyment?”, “Did you learn or do something interesting yesterday?”\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Negative affect** : is defined as the average of three negative affect measures in GWP. They are worry, sadness and anger, respectively the responses to “Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Worry?”, “Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Sadness?”, and “Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Anger?”\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Gini of household income** : reported in the Gallup World Poll (variable name giniIncGallup). The income variable is described in Gallup’s “Worldwide Research Methodology And Codebook” as “Household Income International Dollars [...] To calculate income, respondents are asked to report their household income in local currency. Those respondents who have difficulty answering the question are presented a set of ranges in local currency and are asked which group they fall into. Income variables are created by converting local currency to International Dollars (ID) using purchasing power parity (PPP) ratios.” The gini measure is generated using STATA command ineqdec0 by WP5-year with sample weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Institutional trust**: The first principal component of the following five measures: confidence in the national government, confidence in the judicial system and courts, confidence in the honesty of elections, confidence in the local police force, and perceived corruption in business. This principal component is then used to create a binary measure of high institutional trust using the 75th percentile in the global distribution as the cutoff point; this way a country whose population tends to have a low level of institutional trust in the global distribution will have a low average institutional trust at the national level. This measure is not available for all countries since not all surveys in all countries ask all of the questions that are used to derive the principal component.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Human Freedom Index variable definition\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Rule of law** :  The rule of law is an essential condition of freedom that protects the individual from coercion by others. Individual freedom is dependent on the rule of law, a broad concept that encompasses due process, equal treatment under the law, accountability of government officials and notions of fairness, predictability and justice. Indicators from the World Justice Project's (WJP) Rule of Law Index that are consistent with this definition of freedom are used. The indicators used not only rate the degree to which the rule of law may be undermined; they also measure negative rights. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Security and safety** : The security and safety category measures actual crimes committed. It attempts to measure the degree to which people who have not violated the equal rights of others are physically assaulted, kidnapped or killed, or their physical integrity or safety is otherwise violated. Indicators include measurements for homicide rate; disappearances, conflicts and terrorism; violent conflicts and organized conflicts; level of fatalities and injuries that result from terrorism; freedom from torture and extent to which political killings are practiced and the degree to which they are incited and approved by the government.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Movement** : Freedom to travel. Indicators include freedom of foreign movement, freedom of movement for men and freedom of movement for women within the jurisdiction. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Religion** : Free societies respect the right to practice a religion of one's choosing. Two components make up the measure of religious freedom, the first is based on two indicators that broadly rate the extent of freedom of religion in society, including the right to practice and choose one's religions. The second component gauges the repression of religious organizations by government.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Association, assembly, and civil society** : The freedom to associate and assemble with peaceful individuals or organizations of one's choice and to form or join organizations for political, commercial or other ends. This category is made up of the following components : the freedom of civil society organizations to enter and exit public life; freedom of assembly, including the ability to carry out peaceful protests; freedom to form and run political parties, including the extent to which parties are banned or face barriers and the degree of autonomy of opposition parties; and government repression of civil society.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Expression and information** : This category measures a broad range of freedoms, including that affecting personal expression, the press and use of the internet. Components in this category include press killed, press jailed, freedom of academic and cultural expression; harassment of journalists, government attempts to censor print and broadcast media and the internet, the extent of censorship among journalists and the press and the use of security or other laws to punish journalists, and other laws and regulations that influence media content. Indicators also capture the degree to which political pressure comes to bear on media coverage and takes into account state and non-state harassment of, and violence toward, journalists.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Relationships** : Freedom to have intimate and familial relationships with others and that those be based on equal rights between males and females. Components include a male-to-male relationship that gauges the extent to which sexual relationships between men are legal and a female-to-female indicator that gauges the same for relationships between women. Other components are divorce rates, inheritance rights and daughters in inheritance matters. The last component measures the prevalence of female genital mutilation among the population of women ages 15-49 years in a given country.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Size of government** : Measured as general government consumption spending as a percentage of total consumption. The rating for this component, as with many of the components, is designed to mirror the actual distribution of the raw data but on a 0-to-10 scale. The 1990 data were used to derive the maximum and minimum values for this component. Countries with a larger proportion of government expenditures received lower ratings. In contrast, as the ratio approaches the maximum value, the ratio moves toward 0. Components include government consumption, transfers and subsidies, government investment, top marginal tax rate and state ownerships of assets. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Legal system and property rights** : Measures are based on factors such as judicial independence, impartial courts, protection of property rights, military interference in rule of law and politics, integrity of the legal system, legal enforcement of contracts, regulatory costs of the sale of real property and reliability of police. The rating for the Legal System and Property Rights category are adjusted to reflect inequalities in the legal treatment of women. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sound money** : This component measures the average annual growth of the money supply in the past five years minus average annual growth of real GDP in the past 10 years. Countries where growth of the money supply greatly exceeds growth of real output receive lower ratings. The M1 money supply (basically defined as checkable deposits plus currency in circulation) figures were used to measure the growth rate of the money supply. Components include money growth, standard deviation of inflation, inflation and freedom to own foreign currency bank accounts. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Freedom to trade internationally** : Measures are based on tariffs (the amount of tax on international trade as a share of exports and imports), regulatory trade barriers, black-market exchange rates and controls of the movement of capital and people.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Regulation** : The rating for the Regulation category is calculated as the average of its three components—credit\n",
